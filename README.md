# Description

Just a small showcase of loguru incredible easiness for creating, good, organized and meaningful logs in a very straight foward way, using mostly python built ins to do so.

The project consists in creating a small script just to emulate a regular pipeline and a logging decorator, which provides some useful information about our functions and project.
